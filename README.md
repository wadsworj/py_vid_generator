# py_vid_generator
a program to generate simple videos based on data files (scripts)

create videos using text scripts (json data files).

render 'scenes' to output videos that can then be used in an external video editor.

currently in prototype mode using pygame as the 'renderer'. Future plan is to have multiple 'renderers' and output to formats that can be understood by external programs (blender? after effects? etc?)
